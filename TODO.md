## v2.0

* add test command and response message
* figure out a better solution for tracking intervals than resetting every send.
* get firmware release working

## Long Term

* other app.* callbacks to register various things?

* bug with reconnecting (eg ESP.restart not going down the hello path)

* currently we have a chance of collisions if http api + websockets requests happen simulataneously.
  * best to solve this as a mutex (but is this really needed?)

* allow turning off http server (mqtt / serial only)
* allow turning off wifi (serial only)

* add support for revived ESPAsyncWebServer:
